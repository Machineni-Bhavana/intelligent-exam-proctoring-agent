# **Intelligent Exam Proctoring Agent Using Logical Reasoning**

## **About the Project**

This project presents a **utility-based intelligent agent** designed to assist **online exam invigilation** in a **simulated environment**.
Instead of making rigid yes/no decisions, the agent observes exam-related behaviours, reasons using **logical rules combined with utility values**, and produces **clear, explainable risk assessments** to support **human decision-making**.

The focus of the project is on **reasoning under uncertainty**, **transparent decision processes**, and the practical application of **core Artificial Intelligence concepts**.

## **What the Agent Does**

* Observes **simulated online exam behaviour**
* Evaluates multiple behavioural cues using **logical reasoning**
* Handles **partial and uncertain observations**
* Assigns a **risk level with a confidence score**
* Explains **why** a particular decision was made

The system functions as a **decision-support tool**, not an automated enforcement mechanism.

## **Agent Design (PEAS Framework)**

* **Environment:** Simulated online examination setting
* **Percepts:** Tab switches, head movements, inactivity time, multiple face detection
* **Reasoning:** **Rule-based logic** with **utility-based evaluation**
* **Actions:** Ignore behaviour, flag for review, or alert an invigilator with explanation

## **Technologies Used**

* **Python**
* **Streamlit** (for interactive demonstration)
* **Git and GitHub**

---

## **Current Status**

* **Intelligent agent architecture** designed
* **Utility-based reasoning engine** implemented
* **Explanation module** completed
* **Streamlit interface** available for demonstration

## **Purpose**

This project is developed for **academic learning** to demonstrate key AI principles such as **intelligent agents**, **logical reasoning**, **utility-based decision making**, **handling uncertainty**, and **explainable AI**.
